This GitHub repository, **Code-Factory**, is a public collection of Java-based projects. It contains multiple project directories (Project1, Project2, etc.) and a main Java file (`Main.java`). The repository is designed to showcase programming examples and serves as a learning or demonstration hub for Java programming. A `README` file is currently missing, which could provide further context about the purpose and usage of these projects.
