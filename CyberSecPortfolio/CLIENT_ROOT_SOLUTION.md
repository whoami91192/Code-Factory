# 🎯 Solution: Client Root Directory Issue

## ✅ Problem Identified:
You set `client/` as the root directory in Vercel, so it can't see the `api/` folder outside the client directory.

## 🔧 Solution Applied:

### ✅ What I've Done:
1. **Created `client/api/contact.js`** - API function inside client folder
2. **Added nodemailer** to `client/package.json` dependencies
3. **Same email functionality** with cyber security theme

### 📁 New Structure:
```
client/
├── api/
│   └── contact.js  ← API function here now
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── Contact.tsx
└── package.json  ← includes nodemailer
```

## 🚀 Next Steps:

### 1. **Commit & Push Changes**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add API function to client folder for Vercel deployment"
git push
```

### 2. **Vercel Will Auto-Deploy**
- The new `client/api/contact.js` will be detected
- Vercel will deploy it as a serverless function

### 3. **Add Environment Variables**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find project: `code-factory-651d`
3. **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add:
   ```
   Name: SMTP_USER
   Value: gianniskatsibris@gmail.com
   
   Name: SMTP_PASS
   Value: mfyv psfc shes hyga
   
   Name: SMTP_FROM
   Value: gianniskatsibris@gmail.com
   ```

### 4. **Test the Contact Form**
1. Visit: https://code-factory-651d.vercel.app/contact
2. Fill out the form
3. Click "Send Message"
4. Check gianniskatsibris@gmail.com

## 🎯 Expected Result:
- ✅ No more 404 errors
- ✅ Contact form submits successfully
- ✅ Email arrives with cyber security theme
- ✅ All sender details included

## 🔍 If Still Not Working:

### Check Functions Tab:
1. Vercel Dashboard → Functions
2. Look for `contact` function
3. Should show `client/api/contact.js`

### Check Build Logs:
1. Deployments → Latest deployment
2. Look for any API function deployment messages

## 🎉 Success Indicators:
- ✅ Function appears in Functions tab
- ✅ No console errors when submitting form
- ✅ Email received at gianniskatsibris@gmail.com
- ✅ Email has proper formatting

## 💡 Alternative (If Needed):
If this doesn't work, you can also:
1. Change root directory from `client/` to `/` (root)
2. This will let Vercel see the original `api/` folder
3. But requires reconfiguring the build settings

**Try the current solution first - it should work perfectly!** 🚀
