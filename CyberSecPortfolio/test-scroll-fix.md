# Scroll Fix Test Instructions

## Problem
The home page was opening directly at the Interactive Terminal section instead of showing the beginning of the page.

## Solution Applied
1. **Enhanced PageScrollToTop component** - Added better scroll handling with delays
2. **Added scroll reset to Home component** - Ensures page starts at top when mounted
3. **Added hash fragment clearing** - Removes any URL hash that might cause unwanted scrolling
4. **Added console logging** - For debugging scroll behavior

#### How to Test

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test the Home Page
1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. The page should start at the top (Hero section)
3. Check the browser console for scroll-related logs

### 3. Test Navigation
1. Scroll down to the Interactive Terminal section
2. Navigate to another page (e.g., `/about`)
3. Navigate back to home (`/`)
4. The page should start at the top again

### 4. Test the Test Page
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/test-scroll`
2. Scroll down to see multiple sections
3. Navigate away and back
4. Should start at the top

## Console Logs to Look For
- `PageScrollToTop: pathname changed to /`
- `PageScrollToTop: Scrolling to top`
- `Home component: Scrolling to top on mount`
- `Home component: Additional scroll to top after delay`

## Files Modified
- `client/src/components/PageScrollToTop.tsx`
- `client/src/pages/Home.tsx`
- `client/src/App.tsx` (added test route)
- `client/src/pages/TestScroll.tsx` (new test page)

## Expected Behavior
- Home page should always start at the top
- Navigation between pages should reset scroll position
- No unwanted scrolling to specific sections
- Console logs should show scroll operations

## If Problem Persists
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify that all components are loading properly
3. Check if there are any CSS scroll behaviors
4. Test in different browsers
5. Clear browser cache and try again
